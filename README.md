# QuantumProgrammingTutorialsQiskit
Runnign a basic Hadamard gate and CX gate and  observing the output of the quantum circuit on a simulated quantum chip and an actual IBM quantum chip (ibmq_16_melbourne 16 Qubit).
observe the existence of 01 and 10 state in addition to 00 and 11 due to quantum noise however during simulation we see only 00 and 11 since conditions are ideal in case of a simulation.
